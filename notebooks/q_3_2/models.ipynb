BoW and TF-IDF**\n","* **BoW Configuration**: The optimal parameters for the Bag of Words (BoW) approach with Logistic Regression include a specific range for max_df and min_df, a bigram (ngram_2: 2), and a substantial number of features (bow_max_features: 19340). The inclusion of an extra_features_weight_factor of 3 indicates the model benefits from emphasizing additional features alongside the textual content. The regularization strength (C: 0.15042289892477853) and choice of solver as 'liblinear' suggest a model that balances complexity and computational efficiency, achieving solid performance across all metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1) at 0.80, with a relatively quick total time of 60.37 seconds.\n","\n","* **TF-IDF Configuration**: The TF-IDF variant introduces slightly different parameters, with adjustments in max_df, min_df, and max_features_tfidf (17339), alongside TF-IDF specific parameters (norm: 'l2', smooth_idf: True, sublinear_tf: True). The extra_features_weight_factor remains at 3, underscoring the consistent value of additional features. The higher C value (1.1926655328748625) and use of the 'saga' solver indicate a preference for a more robust regularization approach, which maintains comparable performance metrics to the BoW model but with a slightly longer computation time (77.23 seconds).\n","\n","**XGBooster with BoW and TF-IDF**\n","* **BoW Configuration**: The XGBoost model with BoW features highlights an aggressive approach to feature selection and ensemble complexity (n_estimators: 547, max_depth: 10, learning_rate: 0.1821439563726806). The extra_features_weight_factor of 3 continues to play a significant role, enhancing model performance with an optimal mix of textual and additional features. This configuration leads to improved accuracy and F1 scores (0.83) compared to Logistic Regression at the cost of increased computational time (141.58 seconds).\n","\n","* **TF-IDF Configuration**: With TF-IDF, the XGBoost model adjusts its feature handling (max_features_tfidf: 19777) and slightly alters its ensemble strategy (n_estimators: 546, max_depth: 10). Notably, the extra_features_weight_factor is reduced to 2, possibly indicating a different valuation of additional features when combined with TF-IDF's normalized feature set. Despite these changes, performance metrics mirror those of the BoW configuration, but with a significant increase in computation time (700.15 seconds), suggesting a more complex model that is computationally intensive to train."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["**Feature Representation**: The results indicate that both Logistic Regression and XGBoost models achieve similar performance levels with BoW and TF-IDF representations\\\n","**Model Selection**: XGBoost shows a slight advantage over Logistic Regression in terms of accuracy and F1 scores, which could
